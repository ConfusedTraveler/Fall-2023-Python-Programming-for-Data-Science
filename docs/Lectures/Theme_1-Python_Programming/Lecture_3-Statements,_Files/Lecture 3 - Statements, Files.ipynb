    "Python belongs to the group of **interpreted languages**, or they are also called *scripting languages* (other languages in this group are Perl, Ruby). The Python interpreter reads the statements in source files and converts them into byte code files, which are afterwards executed by the PVM. Conversely, Java, C, and C++ belong to the group of **compiled languages**. In these languages, a compiler converts the source files' statements into binary machine code, which are afterwards executed by the computer hardware. Note that byte code files are different than binary machine code files. Consequently, running Python programs is slower than running C or C++ programs, because the code is interpreted as it is executed. On the other hand, writing and testing Python programs is faster and easier than writing and testing programs with the compiled languages. (One last clarification: Python does compile source files, but the result is not a binary machine code, and because of that it is not considered a compiled language)."
