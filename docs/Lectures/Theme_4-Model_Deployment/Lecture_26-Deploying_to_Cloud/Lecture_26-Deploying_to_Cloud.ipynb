    "**Cloud Computing**, also referred to as the Cloud, delivers services hosted over a network, which can include data analytics, storage, databases, networking, and other services. The service is often in the form of a *public cloud*  offered to the public over the Internet by cloud service providers, or it can be a *private cloud* that is owned by an organization that maintains the services on a private network. \n",

    "Public Cloud Computing services include Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, and others.\n",

    "- *Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)*: access to infrastructure, consisting of servers, virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, or databases.\n",
    "- *Platform as a Service (PaaS)*: access to a platform for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications, using infrastructure managed by the provider. \n",
    "- *Software as a Service (SaaS)*: access to software applications, that are developed and managed by the provider using the provider's infrastructure. \n",

    "The advantages of using Cloud Computing include convenient access to latest computational resources (without the need to purchase hardware or software), access to structured environments (preinstalled libraries) for running tasks, pay for what you need only, ability to quickly scale projects, improved efficiency by relying on infrastructure hosted and managed by the cloud provider, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Computing is especially important for managing  Data Science projects, which often require access to GPUs and large compute resources, storing large amounts of data, access to databases, deploying solutions for access by end-users, and similar. In addition, most Cloud providers have developed some form of AutoML tools that enable organizations without Data Science expertise to implement data analytics workflows into their projects. \n",
